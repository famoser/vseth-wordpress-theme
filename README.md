# VSETH Wordpress Theme

The wordpress [twentytwenty](https://kinsta.com/de/blog/twenty-twenty-theme/) theme was adapted to fit within the VSETH CI. Only minimal changes were made to not jepardize the well-made usability & design choices of the original theme. To allow to update the original theme, the VSETH specifics was developed as part of a [Child Theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/).

The only functionality additionally needed were to display the various organisations connected to the VSETH (and make them discoverable). For this the `organisations` plugin was developed: It allows to create organisations with image, social links, tags and description in multiple languages. They are displayed to the end-user in a isotope-managed masonry grid, filterable using the tags. 

The theme went online in the spring semester 2020: https://vseth.ethz.ch/. The organisations view can be found here: https://vseth.ethz.ch/organisationen/.
